# UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp Project #3- Team 1
## Analysis and visualizations of EV charging stations in relations to population, as well as visualization of services around charging stations and a breakdown of electric vehicle registration information in Washington State. 

## Why did we choose this topic?
Electric cars have been noticeably on the incline in the last decade. With strong efforts by governments worldwide to go green and the incentivization of regenerative energy sources, our team was interested in the rate of change of the increase of electric cars along with the development of charging stations throughout the state of Washington. 

## Data Sources
We honed in on Washington State as registered car data was more publicly accessible. Sources being used are: 
- EV Charging Station Information: [Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/states)
- EV Registration Data: [State of Washington Open Data Portal- EV Registrations by County](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Size-History-By-County/3d5d-sdqb/about_data)
- Zip Code Population Data: [US Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-Year Data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html)

## Libraries Used
- [Geoapify API Documentation](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/place-details/#api/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## Database used to host our project
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

We plan to use a map with filters that are including but not limited to: 
- Population density - by zipcode
- Charging stations - markers that show each station 
- Restaurants - Amount & relative distance to charging stations
- Entertainment - Amount & relative distance to charging stations
